First I created a new repository on GitHub.
Then I created my index.html, style.css and README.md files in sublime text.
From there I uploading those files to Terminal.
From Terminal I pushed them to the Git repository.
Once those files were in the repository I created, I signed into my Netlify account. 
I connected my Netlify account to my GitHub account. 
After that I was able to create my siye by choosing my repository and Netflify gave me a random domain.
